# Projectile Motion Simulation
### Version 0.01 - 8/1/24

## Overview
The Projectile Motion Simulation (PMS) has been designed as part of a project for the OU. The basic outlines of the PMS has basic outlines currently,
currently the porject will be able to shoot a small ball out fromn a cannon, and you will be able to see how much motion and force was required to create
